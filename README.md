#Project Title
One paragraph of project description goes here.
This is a basic JavaFX program that opens a window and uses a button to print "Hello World" to the console. This was made by Angel Molina on August 24, 2019 as an assignment for Object-Oriented Programming at FGCU.

##Documentation
Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: [Text to appear](URL) 
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. 
Sample: [JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)
